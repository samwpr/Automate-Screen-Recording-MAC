# Automate Screen Recording for MAC
This script will start a screen recording using mac's build in QuickTime Player and will automatically stop the screen recording at your desired time. 

Features: 
- Start recording 
- Ensures your mac doesn't go to sleep which will terminate the program 
- Stop the recording at your targetted time 
- Turn of your computer 

Made this becuase my lectures are from 630pm - 1030pm but I usually turn in at 930pm.
